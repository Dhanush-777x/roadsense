# RoadSense â€“ Drive Safe with Real-Time Road Warnings

**RoadSense** is a mobile navigation application built with Flutter that helps
users navigate roads safely and efficiently. The primary goal of the app is to
**warn drivers about upcoming obstacles**, such as **speed breakers and
potholes**, along their route. In addition to real-time route planning, the app
enhances road awareness using integrated APIs and technologies for a seamless
and accurate navigation experience.


## Features

- **Interactive Maps** using OpenStreetMap API
- **Autocomplete Search** using Photon API
- **Routing & Directions** powered by OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine)
- **Warn Drivers about upcoming obstacles**
- **Smooth UI** developed with Flutter 

## Technologies Used

- **OpenStreetMap API**: Provides map data and tiles for rendering interactive maps.
- **Photon API**: Used for autocomplete search to make location-based queries more efficient.
- **OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine)**: Provides fast routing and directions for users.
- **Flutter**: The mobile development framework used to build the app for both iOS and Android.
